# INLA

Please do not use this repo to install INLA in your system. INLA should always be installed from the developers' website, please see (http://www.r-inla.org/download)[http://www.r-inla.org/download]. The sole reason for this github page is to allow easy continuous integration using Travis-CI, which can automatically install packages directly from github pages with ease. This can be of use in package development, when your package depends explicitly or implicitly on INLA.
